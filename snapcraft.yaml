description: |
  EGGNOGG+, a competitive local-multiplayer arcade game of immortals sword-fighting to the death. Stab each other, hurl and ricochet your swords off of the walls and ceilings, engage in pugilism, jump over spike pits to make it past your eternal foe and reach the far end of the strange complex. Hurl yourself triumphantly, and finally, into the EGGNOGG. Includes procedurally generated bytebeat tunes that you can edit live, and also create additional songs. Supports configurable keyboard and joystick for both players.
